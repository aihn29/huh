                Hi! I am Jaren, I was born on August 29, 2006. i am 18 years old. I was born in a small municipality, it is the Pulupandan, where life was simple and peaceful. Growing up, I spent most of my time outdoors, playing with friends and exploring nature. My childhood was filled with moments of joy, curiosity, and learning, which shaped who I am today.

            <img src="pic/hi.jpg" alt="Highschool Photo" style= width:50%; height:450px;>
            <p>
                This is when I have discovered who I really am. I have explored alot of different things, and everything that I have learned shaped me into the version that I am right now. I have enjoy every bit of my time in highschool. It was full of good memories and different people. It was an eye opener and I have got out of my shell at some point. It was a thrilling ride but I enjoyed it together with the friends I have met along the way.

    <p>
        This is where life's starting to feels real. This is where you will feel that you're already growing up, and not the same teenager you have ever been. You will worry about alot of things, but you will also meet new people who will help you get through a heavy and tiring day. Despite of the changing environment and culture, I still carry it like a champ everyday, with the help of my old friends that is still with me in this point of my life. College is tiring but the thrill that comes with it keeps you going. I have still alot of journey to take, and all I can say is <i>"Padayon"</i>

    <p>
        My mother is Jean Carbos. It was because of her that I still get through the toughest days. She is my inspiration, and all my hardwork is for her. I have three step siblings. The oldest is Jewel Mae Carbos, she is 23 years old. My brothers are John Nicolai and Jelo Rovi, Jelo as the youngest. Growing up, I was not with them very often, but the bond of us will never topped by anyone. I love my family, and I am contented with having them. All I wish is for them to get healthy and have a happy and meaningful life.
